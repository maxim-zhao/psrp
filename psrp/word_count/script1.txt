[23A]
Don't let this get out, but there's a fortune-teller named Damoa who is in possession of a crystal that LaShiec hates.<wait more>

[23C]
There must be something secret about that crystal.<wait>

This flame is lit during each centennial solar eclipse.<wait more>

If you give me a dragon's jewel, however, I'll share the flame with you.<wait more>

Do we have an agreement?<end>

[244]
Well then, please accept this Eclipse Torch.<wait>

[246]
You don't want it?! Then, ah, for what did you come here?<wait>

You mean to say you don't have the jewel?! Don't toy with me!<wait>

I have an apprentice named Lutz in Maharu Cave. Do you know him?<end>
