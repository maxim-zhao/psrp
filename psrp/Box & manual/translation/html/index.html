<h2>This is the world of Phantasy Star!</h2>

Algol has three planets: Palma, the third planet; Motavia, the second planet;
and Dezoris, the third planet. To start, we'll show you parts of Palma and
Motavia. As you progress through the game, you'll see the parts not shown on
the maps, as well as the planet Dezoris.

<h2>Alisa's peaceful livelihood is snatched away!</h2>
<img align=left src=story1.png width=342 height=230 alt="Palman street">
It is the year AW342. Palma, the first planet of the Algol star system, has
reached the peak of its prosperity under its king, LaShiec. The other planets
of Algol are being pioneered by colonists, and plans for resource harvesting
and farming facilities are progressing favourably. Around the clock, inter-
planetary shuttles travel between the spaceports on Palma and Motavia, Algol's
second planet, and it has been decided that construction of a spaceport on
Dezoris, the third planet, will begin within years. However, in spring of this
year, ghastly rumours began to spread. It seemed that the nobles of the ruling
class had become possessed with heathenism, and that LaShiec, who had been
possessed the strongest, had traded away Algol in exchange for eternal life.
<p>
The rumours have turned out to be true. Grotesque creatures have staggered
their way to every corner of every planet of Algol, threatening the livelihood
of its people. Something dreadful is about to unfold…
<br clear=all><hr>
<img align=right src=story2.png width=239 height=320 alt="Alisa comes to Nero">
"Nero?! What happened?!"
<p>
The girl's scream shredded the surrounding air.
<p>
The girl's name is Alisa. She has grown up here in Camineet, the residential
district of Palma's capital city. This year she turns 15 years old. Nero, her
older brother, is 18 years old, and works as a baggage handler at Paseo
spaceport. Alisa and Nero's parents died young, and the two siblings came to
survive by relying on each other.
<p>
The robot police shoved Nero to the ground. Nero looked as though he were a
piece of tattered cloth. Sneering at Alisa, the robot police coldly declared,
<p>
<img align=left src=story3.png width=358 height=259 alt="Alisa cries">
"This is what you get for poking around in LaShiec's affairs! Maybe now you'll
behave yourself - if you want to stay in one piece!"
<p>
Alisa and her dying brother were left behind on the cold concrete. When Alisa
grasped Nero's hand, he opened his eyes slightly, and looked hard at her.
<p>
"Alisa, listen to me. LaShiec has invited disaster upon Algol, and now our
world is facing ruin. I was trying to find out what LaShiec is planning, but I
couldn't find out much by working on my own."
<p>
Tears formed in Nero's eyes. It was the first time Alisa had seem her brother cry.
<p>
"While I was gathering information on LaShiec, I heard about a powerful man
called Tylon. If you join forces with him, maybe the two of you can rescue
Algol...
<p>
"Alisa… I can't stand the pain any longer… Forgive me… I accomplished nothing,
and now I have to die and leave you all alone…"
<p>
"Nero! Nero!!"
<p>
<img align=right src=story4.png width=215 height=320 alt="Alisa decides to seek revenge">
Alisa began to scream. But Nero's eyes never opened again.
<p>
Before long, the area became covered in twilight. Alisa's eyes, though covered
in dried tears, had become full of powerful authority. Alisa took Nero's short
sword, which he carried on his hip, and held it to her chest, swearing,
<p>
"Nero, I will carry on your will. I will overthrow LaShiec and restore harmony
to Algol."
<p>
And so begins Alisa's epic crusade.

<li>The game begins immediately after Alisa decides to try to overthrow Emperor
LaShiec.
<li>First, Alisa must set out in order to search for Tylon. Along the way, Alisa
will also come across Myau and Lutz. The group of four companions will continue
the journey together.
<li>If you gather information from villagers and townspeople during the journey,
you will likely be able to figure out what to do next.
<li>By battling monsters, Alisa and her companions will accumulate experience
and become more powerful. They will also increase their wealth.
<li>If you save up (enough) money, you can buy weapons, armor, and items.
Initially, Alisa carries a Short Sword and wears Leather Clothes. It's a good
idea to obtain increasingly powerful equipment as the game progresses.
<li>Once you have put together the proper balance of information, weapons,
armor and items, you can move towards your final destination!

<h3>Palma (the first planet)</h3>

A beautiful planet with abundant greenery, just like our own Earth.
Civilisation developed here in ancient times, and has now even expanded to
settlements on Motavia and Dezoris.

<h3>Motavia (the second planet)</h3>

Motavia is a developing planet with a newly-opened spaceport. It slowly
revolves around the sun, cutting across the orbit of the planet Palma. Of the
three planets, it is presently the closest to the sun, and its surface is dry
and deserted.

<h3>Dezoris (the third planet)</h3>

Dezoris is the farthest planet from the sun, and is locked in ice. Its
development has been delayed for this reason. Once every 100 years, the sun
becomes hidden by the planet Palma, causing a solar eclipse. At that time, the
planet loses what little light it has, becoming completely dark. It is said
that, because the eclipse lasts for ten days, the people light sacred flames
and wait for the eclipse to end.

There are three types of shops: Armor shops, which sell weapons and armor;
Drug stores, which sell medicines; and Tool shops, which sell various items.

When you enter a shop, choose the items you want to buy after you see the price
list. If you don't want to buy anything, press button 1. Also, in Tool shops,
you can sell items you no longer want.

<h2>Organise your equipment to suit each individual</h2>

Weapons and armor are useless if you simply carry them around. When you buy
weapons and armor, be sure to Equip them. A character's unique qualities may
affect what that character may equip. For example, Myau is an animal, so he
can't equip the kinds of weapons that humans can.

<img align=right src=magic1.png width=218 height=294 alt="Lutz performs Fire magic">
As Alisa, Myau and Lutz gain levels, they will also come to learn more and more magic spells. Magic spells consume MP each time they are used, so if you run out of MP, you won't be able to use them. Also, some spells, can be used when exploring, while others can be used during battle. You will most definitely need to master effective use of magic spells in order to succeed in your quest.
