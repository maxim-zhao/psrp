4b. A stronger form of graphics compression


A small comparison of algorithms on the title screen:

Raw:         $2000
PS encoder:  $1742 (*)
FC encoder:  $1617
PSG encoder: $14CE ($274 saved)

The Phantasy Star Gaiden decoder works like the PS one by combining the
color planes. But it builds the whole 4-bpp tile before batch writing to
VRAM.

Speed hit for complexity seems minor if any.

The algorithm is changed to store the # tiles with the bitmap data.
