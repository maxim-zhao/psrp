# Notes: The truth-telling Dezorians and the lying Dezorians speak different dialects of Japanese. The truth-tellers end their sentences with ZURA, and the liars end theirs with DASU. In this English version, the truth-tellers say verb-affirmative things like ’it does’ and ’you will’ at the ends of sentences, and the liars say truth-affirming things like ’no joke’, ’seriously’, etc. in their sentences.
# French and Brazilian Portuguese use similar patterns to English.
