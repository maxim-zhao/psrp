. What is Phantasy Star

Phantasy Star is a ground-breaking RPG from 1987. It was the first console RPG
released in the US; it was one of the first sci-fi-based RPGs, although has a
unique mix of  fantasy and sci-fi; and it introduced many concepts to the genre.

It was ground-breakingly large - taking place across three planets, with large,
colourful, animated monsters. It was one of the first (and only) games to
feature a female protagonist with real characterisation and character
development, without resorting to videogaming's female sterotypes.

. Authors' notes

Z80 Gaiden:

Paul Jensen had posted a translated script with a good majority of the lists in
2001-2002. I wasn't aware of its existence until someone mentioned a
retranslation project that didn't make fully it to completion yet.

The game proved to be an interesting task -- lack of useful padding space.
Narrative and items fitting into a mere 15.67 KB. Need patience with this one.

So this project was designed to keep the FM music intact while squeezing in
more full item descriptions and textual script content.

Not enough thanks can be directed to Mr. Jensen for his care in posting his
retranslation publicly online and keeping it freely accessible for all this
time.

Maxim:

This has been a long time coming. When I received the near-complete translation
from Z80 Gaiden (who goes by several names and has done amazing work on
translations before) I was amazed - it was 90% done. Unfortunately, as the
aphorism says,

"The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time.
The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development
time."

Over the last 2 years or so I have worked on it on and off, and while I'm
fairly confident that I've fixed most of the bugs, it's sadly not been tested
as much as I'd like; so I'm committed to keep working on it.

I hope you all enjoy TheRedEye's script changes. We've approached this project
with the aim of bringing you the experience of the original Japanese version,
but there have been a few minor changes to bring the script alive, rather than
do it word-for-word. We'd like to think this is what the original translation
should have been, 18 years ago.

It's also a great framework for further (re-)translation into more languages.
Please get in touch if you can do some serious work on that.
