----------------------------------------------------------

Paul Jensen had posted a translated script with a good majority of
the lists in 2001-2002. I wasn't aware of its existence until someone
mentioned a retranslation project that didn't make fully it to completion yet.

The game proved to be an interesting task -- lack of useful padding space.
Narrative and items fitting into a mere 15.67 KB. Need patience with this one.

So this project was designed to keep the FM music intact while squeezing
in more full item descriptions and textual script content.

Not enough thanks can be directed to Mr. Jensen for his care in posting
his retranslation publicly online and keeping it freely accessible for
all this time.
