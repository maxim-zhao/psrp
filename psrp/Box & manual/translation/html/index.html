<h2>This is the world of Phantasy Star!</h2>

Algol has three planets: Palma, the third planet; Motavia, the second planet;
and Dezoris, the third planet. To start, we'll show you parts of Palma and
Motavia. As you progress through the game, you'll see the parts not shown on
the maps, as well as the planet Dezoris.

<a name=story><h1>Story</h1></a>
<h2>Alisa's peaceful livelihood is snatched away!</h2>
<img align=left src=story1.png>
It is the year AW342. Palma, the first planet of the Algol star system, has
reached the peak of its prosperity under its king, LaShiec. The other planets
of Algol are being pioneered by colonists, and plans for resource harvesting
and farming facilities are progressing favourably. Around the clock, inter-
planetary shuttles travel between the spaceports on Palma and Motavia, Algol's
second planet, and it has been decided that construction of a spaceport on
Dezoris, the third planet, will begin within years. However, in spring of this
year, ghastly rumours began to spread. It seemed that the nobles of the ruling
class had become possessed with heathenism, and that LaShiec, who had been
possessed the strongest, had traded away Algol in exchange for eternal life.
<p>
The rumours have turned out to be true. Grotesque creatures have staggered
their way to every corner of every planet of Algol, threatening the livelihood
of its people. Something dreadful is about to unfold…
<hr>
<img align=right src=story2.png>
"Nero?! What happened?!"
<p>
The girl's scream shredded the surrounding air.
<p>
The girl's name is Alisa. She has grown up here in Camineet, the residential
district of Palma's capital city. This year she turns 15 years old. Nero, her
older brother, is 18 years old, and works as a baggage handler at Paseo
spaceport. Alisa and Nero's parents died young, and the two siblings came to
survive by relying on each other.
<p>
The robot police shoved Nero to the ground. Nero looked as though he were a
piece of tattered cloth. Sneering at Alisa, the robot police coldly declared,
<p>
<img align=left src=story3.png>
"This is what you get for poking around in LaShiec's affairs! Maybe now you'll
behave yourself - if you want to stay in one piece!"
<p>
Alisa and her dying brother were left behind on the cold concrete. When Alisa
grasped Nero's hand, he opened his eyes slightly, and looked hard at her.
<p>
"Alisa, listen to me. LaShiec has invited disaster upon Algol, and now our
world is facing ruin. I was trying to find out what LaShiec is planning, but I
couldn't find out much by working on my own."
<p>
Tears formed in Nero's eyes. It was the first time Alisa had seem her brother cry.
<p>
"While I was gathering information on LaShiec, I heard about a powerful man
called Tylon. If you join forces with him, maybe the two of you can rescue
Algol...
<p>
"Alisa… I can't stand the pain any longer… Forgive me… I accomplished nothing,
and now I have to die and leave you all alone…"
<p>
"Nero! Nero!!"
<p>
<img align=right src=story4.png>
Alisa began to scream. But Nero's eyes never opened again.
<p>
Before long, the area became covered in twilight. Alisa's eyes, though covered
in dried tears, had become full of powerful authority. Alisa took Nero's short
sword, which he carried on his hip, and held it to her chest, swearing,
<p>
"Nero, I will carry on your will. I will overthrow LaShiec and restore harmony
to Algol."
<p>
And so begins Alisa's epic crusade.

<h2>Cooperate with the companions you meet during your journey</h2>

<div class=floatleft>
<h3 class=label>Alisa</h3>
<img src=alisa.png>
<p>
Heroine of the game. Leaves on a quest to overthrow her enemy LaShiec after her
brother is murdered.
<h3 class=label>Lutz</h1>
<img src=lutz.png>
<p>
An Esper who lives on the planet Motavia, and carries within himself tremendous
magical powers.
</div>
<div class=floatright>
<h3 class=label>Myau</h3>
<img src=myau.png>
<p>
An unusual animal that can speak human language. Alisa's first companion.
<h3 class=label>Tylon</h3>
<img src=tylon.png>
<p>
A warrior, and Alisa's second companion. He has already left on a mission to overthrow LaShiec.
</div>
<ul>
<li>The game begins immediately after Alisa decides to try to overthrow Emperor
LaShiec.
<li>First, Alisa must set out in order to search for Tylon. Along the way, Alisa
will also come across Myau and Lutz. The group of four companions will continue
the journey together.
<li>If you gather information from villagers and townspeople during the journey,
you will likely be able to figure out what to do next.
<li>By battling monsters, Alisa and her companions will accumulate experience
and become more powerful. They will also increase their wealth.
<li>If you save up (enough) money, you can buy weapons, armor, and items.
Initially, Alisa carries a Short Sword and wears Leather Clothes. It's a good
idea to obtain increasingly powerful equipment as the game progresses.
<li>Once you have put together the proper balance of information, weapons,
armor and items, you can move towards your final destination!

<a name=battlecommands><h1>Battle Commands</h1></a>
<h2>Fight monsters, level up!</h2>
<img align=left src=battle.png>
Once you have gathered information from around the town, you should try
exploring outside the town. Outside the town, there are many dreadful monsters,
but fighting those monsters will no doubt make Alisa and her companions more
powerful. When you encounter a monster, the screen will automatically change to
one similar to the one on the left.
<ol class=abc>
<li>The active character. If you have companions, you will need to decide for
each of them one by one.
<li>Battle commands. Decide on a command once you have thought well about who
should do what.
<li>The name of the monster(s) that Alisa and her group are now encountering.
<li>Shows monster count and life force. In this case, indicates 3 monsters,
each with a life force (HP) of 11.

force reaches 0, they will die. Also, a person can use magic as long as they
have MP.
</ol>

<h3 class=box>Explanation of commands</h3>
<ol class=h3>
<li>Attack</li> Strike a monster using the currently equipped weapon.
<li>Magic</li> Alisa, Myau and Lutz can use magic. If you select this, a list
will be displayed, so choose who will use which spell. If it is a healing spell,
specify who to use the spell on. However, be warned that the list is restricted
to battle spells.
<li>Items</li> If you choose this, a list will be displayed that looks just like
the one that appears during exploration.
<li>Speak</li> Some monsters can communicate with Alisa and her companions. If
you communicate with monsters, they might teach you information that only
monsters know.
<li>Run</li> If you choose this command, the entire party will try to run away
from the battle. However, monsters can block their escape route, so the party
might not always be able to escape.
</ol>
Once you have chosen commands for the entire group, the battle will begin at
last. If you eliminate all monsters, or manage to escape, the battle will be
over. If not, you will return to inputting commands.

<h3>Palma (the first planet)</h3>

A beautiful planet with abundant greenery, just like our own Earth.
Civilisation developed here in ancient times, and has now even expanded to
settlements on Motavia and Dezoris.

<h3>Motavia (the second planet)</h3>

Motavia is a developing planet with a newly-opened spaceport. It slowly
revolves around the sun, cutting across the orbit of the planet Palma. Of the
three planets, it is presently the closest to the sun, and its surface is dry
and deserted.

<h3>Dezoris (the third planet)</h3>

Dezoris is the farthest planet from the sun, and is locked in ice. Its
development has been delayed for this reason. Once every 100 years, the sun
becomes hidden by the planet Palma, causing a solar eclipse. At that time, the
planet loses what little light it has, becoming completely dark. It is said
that, because the eclipse lasts for ten days, the people light sacred flames
and wait for the eclipse to end.

The planets of Algol don't just have forests and deserts, but also towns and
villages filled with people. Here are the various places to explore, starting
with the dwellings of Algol's inhabitants.

Not only can villagers and townspeople be found outside, but also inside their
homes. Don't be afraid to pay them a visit. They might teach you some useful
things.

When your HP or MP get low from battling monsters, you can seek medical
attention at a hospital. If you have companions in your group, choose who you
want to have treated. The doctor's fee depends on the amount of HP or MP
restored.

There are three types of shops: Armor shops, which sell weapons and armor;
Drug stores, which sell medicines; and Tool shops, which sell various items.
<p>
When you enter a shop, choose the items you want to buy after you see the price
list. If you don't want to buy anything, press button 1. Also, in Tool shops,
you can sell items you no longer want.

You'll need a Roadpass to pass through one of these. Guards are stationed at
the entrances, and will request that you present one.

<a name=weapons><h1>Weapons and Armor</h1></a>
<h2>Organise your equipment to suit each individual</h2>

Weapons and armor are useless if you simply carry them around. When you buy
weapons and armor, be sure to Equip them. A character's unique qualities may
affect what that character may equip. For example, Myau is an animal, so he
can't equip the kinds of weapons that humans can.

<ol class=h3>
<li>Weapons</li>
<div class=item>
<img src=shortsword.png>
<h3>Short Sword</h3>
Alisa's initial weapon. Just about anyone can handle one.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=ironaxe.png>
<h3>Iron Axe</h3>
Tylon's initial weapon. More powerful than a Short Sword. Handling an axe
requires great physical strength, so only a person with a physique such as
Tylon's can handle it.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=needlegun.png>
<h3>Needle Gun</h3>
Besides swords and axes, weapons also include guns. Only Tylon can equip a gun.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=silvertusk.png>
<h3>Silver Tusk</h3>
This is one of the few weapons that Myau can equip.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=psychowand.png>
<h3>Psycho Wand</h3>
This is the most powerful weapon that Lutz can equip.
</div>
<li>Clothing and Armor</li>
<div class=item>
<img src=leatherclothes.png>
<h3>Leather Clothes</h3>
Everyday Palman clothing. These probably won't hold up well in battle, though.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=whitecloak.png>
<h3>White Cloak</h3>
People with supernatural powers have extraordinary abilities, and therefore
wear cloaks such as this to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=ironarmor.png>
<h3>Iron Armor</h3>
Armor made from iron is extremely heavy, so Alisa can't wear it. This is the
armor that Tylon is wearing when you first meet him.
</div>

<li>Shields</li>
<div class=item>
<img src=leathershield.png>
<h3>Leather Shield</h3>
A shield made of leather is relatively light, so even Alisa can carry one.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=ironshield.png>
<h3>Iron Shield</h3>
A shield made of iron is more durable than a Leather Shield, but also heavy, so
Alisa can't carry one.
</div>
<div class=item>
<img src=laserbarrier.png>
<h3>Laser Barrier</h3>
State-of-the-art protection. Very simple to operate, despite being very high-
tech, so just about anyone can use one.

Many other weapons and defensive items exist besides the ones mentioned here.
Most of them are sold at shops, but many are also hidden in caves and other
locations.

<img align=right src=magic1.png>
As Alisa, Myau and Lutz gain levels, they will also come to learn more and more magic spells. Magic spells consume MP each time they are used, so if you run out of MP, you won't be able to use them. Also, some spells, can be used when exploring, while others can be used during battle. You will most definitely need to master effective use of magic spells in order to succeed in your quest.
